browser-image-to-github
=======================

Try to load an image into github using only the browser




In your repo got to issues and drag your image into the new issue text box. You can then paste the URL of the uploaded image into your github index.html file. This works using phonegap but it is a linked image instead of a local to yourr app image.

Still working on how to get that image into my repo, still just using the browser.
